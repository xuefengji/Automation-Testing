## 行为驱动case

```
Feature: Register User  
	As a developer  
	This is my bdd project  
	Scenario: open register website    
		When I open the register website    
		Then I expect that the title is "注册"    
		Scenario: input username      
			When I set with useremail "mushishi01@qq.com"      
			And I set with username "mushishi01"      
			And I set with password "mushishi"      
			And I set with code "tests"      
			And I click with registerbutton      
			Then I expect that text "验证码错误"
```

当代码执行 And 时，需要将其转换为 when
